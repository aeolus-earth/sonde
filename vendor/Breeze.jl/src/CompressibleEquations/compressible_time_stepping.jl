"""
$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Compute temperature and pressure jointly for `CompressibleModel`.

For compressible dynamics with potential temperature thermodynamics, temperature and
pressure are coupled via the ideal gas law and the potential temperature definition:

```math
θ = T (p₀/p)^κ \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p = ρ R^m T
```

Eliminating the circular dependency gives the direct formula:

```math
T = θ^γ \\left(\\frac{ρ R^m}{p₀}\\right)^{γ-1}
```

where ``γ = c_p / c_v`` is the heat capacity ratio. Once temperature is known,
pressure is computed from the ideal gas law ``p = ρ R^m T``.

This joint computation is necessary because, unlike anelastic dynamics where pressure
comes from a reference state, compressible dynamics requires solving for both
temperature and pressure simultaneously.
