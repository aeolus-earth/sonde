# [Warm-phase saturation adjustment](@id sec:warm-saturation-adjustment)

Warm-phase saturation adjustment is a model for water droplet nucleation that assumes that water vapor
in excess of the saturation specific humidity is instantaneously converted to liquid water.
Mixed-phase saturation adjustment is described by [Pressel2015](@citet).

## Moist static energy and total moisture mass fraction

The saturation adjustment solver (specific to our anelastic formulation) takes four inputs:
* moist static energy ``e``,
* total moisture mass fraction ``qᵗ``,
* height ``z``, and
* reference pressure ``pᵣ``.

Note that moist static energy density ``ρᵣ e`` and moisture density ``ρᵣ qᵗ``
are prognostic variables for [`AtmosphereModel`](@ref) when using [`AnelasticDynamics`](@ref),
where ``ρᵣ`` is the reference density.
With warm-phase microphysics, the moist static energy ``e`` is related to temperature ``T``,
height ``z``, and liquid mass fraction ``qˡ`` by

```math
e ≡ cᵖᵐ \, T + g z - ℒˡᵣ qˡ ,
```

where ``cᵖᵐ`` is the mixture heat capacity, ``g`` is gravitational acceleration,
and ``ℒˡᵣ`` is the latent heat at the energy reference temperature.

## Equilibrium expressions for moist static energy and saturation specific humidity

Saturation adjustment microphysics assumes that temperature and the moisture mass fractions
instantaneously adjust to an equilibrium in which the specific humidity is equal to
or less than the saturation specific humidity. This equilibrium condition implies that
the liquid mass fraction ``qˡ`` is given by

```math
qˡ = \max(0, qᵗ - qᵛ⁺)
```

where ``qᵗ`` is the total moisture mass fraction, and ``qᵛ⁺`` is the saturation
specific humidity at the temperature ``T``. The saturation specific humidity is
defined as

```math
qᵛ⁺ = \frac{ρᵛ⁺}{ρ},
```

where ``ρᵛ⁺ = pᵛ⁺ / Rᵛ T`` is the density associated with the saturation vapor pressure ``pᵛ⁺``
and ``Rᵛ`` is the vapor gas constant. Note that the air density ``ρ`` itself depends
on the specific humidity, since according to the ideal gas law,

```math
ρ = \frac{pᵣ}{Rᵐ T} = \frac{pᵣ}{\left (qᵈ Rᵈ + qᵛ Rᵛ \right ) T} ,
```

where ``qᵈ = 1 - qᵗ`` is the dry air mass fraction, ``qᵛ`` is the specific humidity,
``Rᵈ`` is the dry air gas constant, and ``Rᵛ`` is the vapor gas constant.
The density ``ρ`` is expressed in terms of ``pᵣ`` under the anelastic approximation.

In saturated conditions, we have ``qᵛ ≡ qᵛ⁺`` by definition, which leads to the expression

```math
qᵛ⁺ = \frac{ρᵛ⁺}{ρ} = \frac{Rᵐ}{Rᵛ} \frac{pᵛ⁺}{pᵣ} = \frac{Rᵈ}{Rᵛ} \left ( 1 - qᵗ \right ) \frac{pᵛ⁺}{pᵣ} + qᵛ⁺ \frac{pᵛ⁺}{pᵣ} .
```

Rearranging, we find a new expression for the saturation specific humidity which is
_valid only in saturated conditions and under the assumptions of saturation adjustment_,

```math
qᵛ⁺ = \frac{Rᵈ}{Rᵛ} \left ( 1 - qᵗ \right ) \frac{pᵛ⁺}{pᵣ - pᵛ⁺} .
```

This expression can also be found in paper by [Pressel2015](@citet), equation (37).

## The saturation adjustment algorithm

We compute the saturation adjustment temperature by solving the nonlinear algebraic equation

```math
0 = r(T) ≡ T - \frac{1}{cᵖᵐ} \left [ e - g z + ℒˡᵣ \max(0, qᵗ - qᵛ⁺) \right ] \,
```

where ``r`` is the "residual", using a secant method.

As an example, we consider an air parcel at sea level within a reference state with base pressure of 101325 Pa and a surface temperature ``T₀ = 288``ᵒK.
We first compute the saturation specific humidity assuming a dry-air density,

```@example microphysics
using Breeze
using Breeze.Thermodynamics: saturation_specific_humidity

thermo = ThermodynamicConstants()

p = 101325.0
T = 288.0
Rᵈ = Breeze.Thermodynamics.dry_air_gas_constant(thermo)
ρ = p / (Rᵈ * T)
qᵛ⁺₀ = saturation_specific_humidity(T, ρ, thermo, thermo.liquid)
```

Next, we compute the saturation specific humidity for moist air with
a carefully chosen moist air mass fraction,

```@example microphysics
using Breeze: equilibrium_saturation_specific_humidity, WarmPhaseEquilibrium

qᵗ = 0.012   # [kg kg⁻¹] total specific humidity
qᵛ⁺ = equilibrium_saturation_specific_humidity(T, p, qᵗ, thermo, WarmPhaseEquilibrium())
```

There are two facts of note. First is that we have identified a situation in which ``qᵗ > qᵛ⁺``,
since ``qᵗ = 0.012`` and ``qᵛ⁺ = 0.0104``. Second, note that the saturation specific humidity
is _higher_ if we assume a saturated state, versus the unsaturated result given by ``qᵛ⁺₀`` above.
This is because moist air is less dense than dry air, so the denominator ``ρ`` is smaller
under the assumption of a saturated state.

In equilibrium (and thus under the assumptions of saturation adjustment), the specific humidity is
``qᵛ = qᵛ⁺``, while the liquid mass fraction is

```@example microphysics
qˡ = qᵗ - qᵛ⁺
```

It is small but greater than zero → the typical situation in clouds on Earth.
We are now ready to compute moist static energy,

```@example microphysics
using Breeze.Thermodynamics: MoistureMassFractions

q = MoistureMassFractions(qᵛ⁺, qˡ)
cᵖᵐ = mixture_heat_capacity(q, thermo)
g = thermo.gravitational_acceleration
z = 0.0
ℒˡᵣ = thermo.liquid.reference_latent_heat
e = cᵖᵐ * T + g * z - ℒˡᵣ * qˡ
```

Moist static energy has units ``\mathrm{m^2 / s^2}``, or ``\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{kg}``.
Next we show that the saturation adjustment solver recovers the input temperature
by passing it an "unadjusted" moisture mass fraction into [`Breeze.Microphysics.compute_temperature`](@ref),

```@example microphysics
using Breeze.Microphysics: compute_temperature

microphysics = SaturationAdjustment(equilibrium=WarmPhaseEquilibrium())

q₀ = MoistureMassFractions(qᵗ)
𝒰 = Breeze.Thermodynamics.StaticEnergyState(e, q₀, z, p)
T★ = compute_temperature(𝒰, microphysics, thermo)
```

Finally, we note that the saturation adjustment solver is initialized with a guess corresponding
to the temperature in unsaturated conditions,

```@example microphysics
cᵖᵐ₁ = mixture_heat_capacity(q₀, thermo)
T₁ = (e - g * z) / cᵖᵐ₁
```

The difference between ``T₁`` and the solution ``T_\mathrm{eq}`` is
``T_\mathrm{eq} - T₁ = ℒˡᵣ qˡ / cᵖᵐ`` and is therefore strictly positive.
In other words, ``T₁`` represents a lower bound.

To generate a second guess for the secant solver, we start by estimating
the liquid mass fraction using the guess ``T = T₁``,

```@example microphysics
qᵛ⁺₂ = equilibrium_saturation_specific_humidity(T₁, p, qᵗ, thermo, WarmPhaseEquilibrium())
qˡ₁ = qᵗ - qᵛ⁺₂
```

In general, this represents an _overestimate_ of the liquid mass fraction,
because ``qᵛ⁺₂`` is underestimated by the too-low temperature ``T₁``.
We thus increment the first guess by half of the difference implied by the
estimate ``qˡ₁``,

```@example  microphysics
q₂ = MoistureMassFractions(qᵛ⁺₂, qˡ₁)
cᵖᵐ₂ = mixture_heat_capacity(q₂, thermo)
ΔT = ℒˡᵣ * qˡ₁ / cᵖᵐ₂
T₂ = T₁ + ΔT / 2
```

The residual looks like

```@example microphysics
using Breeze.Microphysics: saturation_adjustment_residual
using CairoMakie

equilibrium = WarmPhaseEquilibrium()
T = 230:0.5:320
r = [saturation_adjustment_residual(Tʲ, 𝒰, thermo, equilibrium) for Tʲ in T]
qᵛ⁺ = [equilibrium_saturation_specific_humidity(Tʲ, p, qᵗ, thermo, equilibrium) for Tʲ in T]

fig = Figure()
axr = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel="Temperature (K)", ylabel="Saturation adjustment residual (K)")
axq = Axis(fig[2, 1], xlabel="Temperature (K)", ylabel="Estimated liquid fraction")
lines!(axr, T, r)
scatter!(axr, 288, 0, marker=:star5, markersize=30, color=:tomato)

lines!(axq, T, max.(0, qᵗ .- qᵛ⁺))

fig
```

There is a kink at the temperature wherein the estimated liquid mass fraction bottoms out.

### Equilibrium states with varying total specific humidity

As a second example, we examine the dependence of temperature on total specific humidity
when the moist static energy is held fixed.

```@example microphysics
using Breeze.Thermodynamics: StaticEnergyState

T₀ = 288
cᵖᵈ = thermo.dry_air.heat_capacity
e₀ = cᵖᵈ * T₀ # representative value
z = 0.0
p = 101325.0

# Vary the total moisture mass fraction:
qᵗ = 0:1e-4:0.035 # [kg kg⁻¹]

T = zeros(length(qᵗ))
qˡ = zeros(length(qᵗ))

for (i, qᵗⁱ) in enumerate(qᵗ)
    q = MoistureMassFractions(qᵗⁱ)
    𝒰 = StaticEnergyState(e₀, q, z, p)
    T[i] = compute_temperature(𝒰, microphysics, thermo)
    qᵛ⁺ = equilibrium_saturation_specific_humidity(T[i], p, qᵗⁱ, thermo, WarmPhaseEquilibrium())
    qˡ[i] = max(0, qᵗⁱ - qᵛ⁺)
end

using CairoMakie

# Hard code the transition index here, e.g. 105 (adjust to your needs)
transition_idx = 105

fig = Figure()
axT = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel="Total specific humidity (kg kg⁻¹)", ylabel="Temperature (ᵒK)")
axq = Axis(fig[2, 1], xlabel="Total specific humidity (kg kg⁻¹)", ylabel="Liquid mass fraction")

lines!(axT, qᵗ, T)
lines!(axq, qᵗ, qˡ)

idx = searchsortedfirst(qˡ, 1e-4)
vlines!(axT, qᵗ[idx], color=:gray, linestyle=:dash, linewidth=2)

### Saturation adjustment with varying height

For a third example, we consider a state with constant moist static energy and total specific humidity
(equivalently, a constant ``θ`` in this reference state),
but at varying heights:

```@example microphysics
using Breeze

grid = RectilinearGrid(size=100, z=(0, 1e4), topology=(Flat, Flat, Bounded))
thermo = ThermodynamicConstants()

θ₀ = 288
p₀ = 101325
reference_state = ReferenceState(grid, thermo;
                                 surface_pressure = p₀,
                                 potential_temperature = θ₀)

qᵗ = 0.005
q = MoistureMassFractions(qᵗ)

z = znodes(grid, Center())
T = zeros(grid.Nz)
qᵛ⁺ = zeros(grid.Nz)
qˡ = zeros(grid.Nz)
rh = zeros(grid.Nz)

# Set a constant moist static energy referenced to z = 0, clear air
cᵖᵐ = mixture_heat_capacity(q, thermo)
Rᵈ = Breeze.Thermodynamics.dry_air_gas_constant(thermo)
g = thermo.gravitational_acceleration

for k = 1:grid.Nz
    pᵣ = reference_state.pressure[1, 1, k]
    Tᵣ = θ₀ * (pᵣ / p₀)^(Rᵈ / cᵖᵈ)
    e₀ = cᵖᵐ * Tᵣ + g * z[k]
    𝒰 = StaticEnergyState(e₀, q, z[k], pᵣ)
    T[k] = compute_temperature(𝒰, microphysics, thermo)

    # Saturation specific humidity via adjustment formula using T[k], pᵣ, and qᵗ
    qᵛ⁺[k] = equilibrium_saturation_specific_humidity(T[k], pᵣ, qᵗ, thermo, WarmPhaseEquilibrium())
    qˡ[k] = max(0, qᵗ - qᵛ⁺[k])
    rh[k] = 100 * min(qᵗ, qᵛ⁺[k]) / qᵛ⁺[k]
end

cᵖᵈ = thermo.dry_air.heat_capacity
g = thermo.gravitational_acceleration

fig = Figure(size=(700, 350))

yticks = 0:2e3:10e3

axT = Axis(fig[1, 1:2]; xlabel = "Temperature (ᵒK)", ylabel = "Height (m)", yticks)
axq⁺ = Axis(fig[1, 3]; xlabel = "Saturation\n specific humidity\n (kg kg⁻¹)",
